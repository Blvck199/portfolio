Outcome This project demonstrates advanced skills in cloud architecture, infrastructure automation, and the ability to efficiently manage and deploy scalable web applications.
Steps Design Architecture: Outlined a multi-tier architecture, defining separation of concerns among web, application, and database layers for optimal scalability and security. Infrastructure as Code with Terraform: Developed Terraform scripts to provision AWS EC2 instances for the web and application layers, RDS for a managed database solution, and S3 for storage of static assets.</description></item><item><title>Containerization with Docker/Kubernetes</title><link>http://www.macpiusegelege.com/projects/beyond_code/containerization_with_kubeernetes/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 12:02:16 -0500</pubDate><guid>http://www.macpiusegelege.com/projects/beyond_code/containerization_with_kubeernetes/</guid><description>Objective Containerize an application and orchestrate its deployment on Kubernetes, demonstrating skills in microservices architecture and container management.
Outcome Highlighted proficiency in container orchestration, scalability, and system resilience through the effective use of Docker and Kubernetes.
Steps Containerization: Containerized the application using Docker, creating Dockerfiles to define the application environment and dependencies. Kubernetes Cluster Setup: Configured a Kubernetes cluster, defining pods, services, and deployments to manage the containerized application components. Scalability and Load Balancing: Implemented horizontal pod autoscaling based on traffic and system load, ensuring the application scales efficiently.</description></item></channel></rss>
