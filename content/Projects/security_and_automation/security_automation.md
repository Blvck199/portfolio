## Objective
Develop automated security checks and a simple intrusion detection system using Python, enhancing the security posture of DevOps practices.

## Outcome
Demonstrated a proactive approach to cybersecurity, integrating automated security tools and practices within the DevOps lifecycle.

## Steps
- **Security Checks Automation:** Developed Python scripts to automate the execution of security checks, scanning for vulnerabilities in the infrastructure.
- **Intrusion Detection System:** Implemented a basic intrusion detection system in Python, monitoring network traffic and system logs for suspicious activities.
- **Integration with DevOps Tools:** Integrated the security automation tools with Jenkins, triggering security scans as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Alerting Mechanism:** Configured alerts to notify the team of any detected vulnerabilities or security breaches, enabling rapid response.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Regularly updated the security scripts to cover new vulnerabilities and adapted the system based on emerging threats.
