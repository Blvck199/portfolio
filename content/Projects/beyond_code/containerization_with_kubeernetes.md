## Objective
Containerize an application and orchestrate its deployment on Kubernetes, demonstrating skills in microservices architecture and container management.

## Outcome
Highlighted proficiency in container orchestration, scalability, and system resilience through the effective use of Docker and Kubernetes.

## Steps
- **Containerization:** Containerized the application using Docker, creating Dockerfiles to define the application environment and dependencies.
- **Kubernetes Cluster Setup:** Configured a Kubernetes cluster, defining pods, services, and deployments to manage the containerized application components.
- **Scalability and Load Balancing:** Implemented horizontal pod autoscaling based on traffic and system load, ensuring the application scales efficiently.
- **Persistent Storage:** Configured persistent volumes and claims to manage data storage across container restarts and scaling.
- **Continuous Deployment:** Integrated Kubernetes with the CI/CD pipeline, enabling automatic deployment of containerized applications upon successful builds.
