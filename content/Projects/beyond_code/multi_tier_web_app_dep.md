## Objective
Deploy a scalable, multi-tier web application using a combination of AWS services and Terraform for infrastructure as code (IaC).

## Outcome
This project demonstrates advanced skills in cloud architecture, infrastructure automation, and the ability to efficiently manage and deploy scalable web applications.

## Steps
- **Design Architecture:** Outlined a multi-tier architecture, defining separation of concerns among web, application, and database layers for optimal scalability and security.
- **Infrastructure as Code with Terraform:** Developed Terraform scripts to provision AWS EC2 instances for the web and application layers, RDS for a managed database solution, and S3 for storage of static assets.
- **Automation and Orchestration:** Automated the entire infrastructure setup, ensuring idempotency in deployment scripts to allow for safe, repeatable deployments.
- **Security and Network Configuration:** Configured security groups, IAM roles, and VPC settings to ensure a secure, isolated network environment for the application components.
- **Monitoring and Management:** Implemented CloudWatch for monitoring the health and performance of the infrastructure, setting up alerts for any critical issues.
